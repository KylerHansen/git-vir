2. Authenticate GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
3. Install this package (probably globally): `npm i -g git-vir`

# How to use

## Push

Use this instead of `git push` when you have a chain of several PRs that are targeting each other and they all need to be updated after the base PR is updated.

1. Start with the base-most branch (the branch closest to your main dev branch) that needs to be updated.
2. Make the necessary changes to that branch (rebase, commit amend, etc.).
3. Run `git-vir push`.
    - If you use a remote name besides `origin`, you can provide that as well with `git-vir <remote-name-here> push`
    - If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve the conflicts, run `git-rebase --continue` until rebase has finished. Then, run `git-vir push` to resume updating the chain.
4. Don't do anything else in the repo's directory until the command is finished.
    - The git-vir command will checkout and push all dependent branches, recursively.
    - If you do anything with the repo while this is happening, it'll likely break this process, including pushing changes to incorrect branches.

## Merge

Use this on a branch that has a chained PR which is ready for merge. It will merge the branch's PR and then rebase all chained branches.

Make sure to include a merge type: `--squash`, `--rebase`, or `--merge`. Like this:

```sh
git-vir merge --squash
```
